# DynamicFusion: Reconstruction and Tracking of Non-rigid Scenes in Real-Time

reconstruct and track dynamic non-rigid scenes in real-time using a single depth camera

Contributions:

1. an approach for non-rigid transformation (volumetric warping) and fusion for a dynamically moving scene
2. efficiency, real-time

Overview

Methods

Dense Non-rigid Warp Field
