# Depth-Regularized Optimization for 3D Gaussian Splatting in Few-Shot Images

We obtained the depth map using a pre-trained monocular depth estimation model (scale ambiguity) and aligning the scale and offset using sparse COLMAP feature points

early stop, the optimization process stops when the depth-guide loss starts to rise

smoothness constraint, ensuring that neighbor 3D points have similar depths

## Results
