# FSGS: Real-Time Few-shot View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting

- Challenge 1: from sparse initialized points to dense coverage
  - Proximity-guided Gaussian Unpooling, it grows new Gaussians by measuring the proximity of existing Gaussians with their neighbors
- Challenge 2: geometry
  - Depth

Some sparse view NeRF methods (Section 2.2)

### Methods

- Gaussian unpooling
  - calculate the (Euclidean) distance between each Gaussian (say $g$) and its nearest $k$ neighbors ($k=3$ in paper)
  - take the average distance as $g$'s _proximity_ (will be updated after any densification or pruning)
  - if the proximity of $g$ exceeds a threshold, "grow" new Gaussians between $g$ and its $k$ neighbors
  - (some heuristic rules to initialize the new Gaussians' scales, colors, opacities)
- Depth guidance
  - pre-trained Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT)
  - a relative loss, Pearson correlation, on 2D (estimated and rendered) depth maps
