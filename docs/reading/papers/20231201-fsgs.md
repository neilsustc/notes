# FSGS: Real-Time Few-shot View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting

- Challenge 1: from sparse initialized points to dense coverage
  - Proximity-guided Gaussian Unpooling(?), it grows new Gaussians by measuring the proximity of existing Gaussians with their neighbors
- Challenge 2: geometry
  - Depth

Some sparse view NeRF methods (Section 2.2)

### Methods

- Gaussian unpooling
  - TODO
- Depth guidance
  - pre-trained Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT)
  - a relative loss, Pearson correlation, on 2D (estimated and rendered) depth maps
